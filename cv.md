My name is Anna, I'm 36 years old, I live in nothern Italy. Almost two years ago I started my [first web developmet basic course](https://www.forteam.it/women-in-front-end-development/) (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, UI/UX Design). 

It lasted around 7 months and right after that i found an internship in the company which is called [426](https://www.426-upgrade.com/en), where I'm still working as a junior developer

It is an outsource company, we create and customize online shops in Shopware 6 system. I write code in JavaScript and PHP/Symfony normally, some twig and SCSS.

As I dont have an IT background I'm eager to learn new things and widen my knowledge. 

I want to improve my performance at work, be more autonomous, get more difficult tasks and work on more complex projects.

I speak good English (C2), good Italian (C1), not so good German (B2) (but good in understanding), I can read in French and when I was young I lived in China and studied Chinese (B1) for two years....but it was loooong ago :)

This is a random code from a plugin that i was creating this week.

```
$fieldCriteria = new Criteria();
$fieldCriteria->addFilter(new EqualsFilter('name', 'addToCartPopup_active'));
$fieldResult = $customFieldRepository->search($fieldCriteria, $context);
```
This is my [RS School CV Project](https://annasya007.github.io/rsschool-cv/).

I've been working as a Junior Developer since 2022 (starting with my internship there), considering in 2023 i was on maternety leave for one year.
