My name is Anna, I'm 36 years old, I live in nothern Italy. Almost two years ago I started my first web developmet basic course (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, UI/UX Design). 

It lasted around 7 months and right after that i found an internship in the company which is called [426](https://www.426-upgrade.com/en), where I'm still working as a junior developer

It is an outsource company, we create and customize online shops in Shopware 6 system. I write code in JavaScript and PHP normally, some twig and SCSS.

As I'm not coming from IT scientific area I'm eager to learn new things and widen my knowledge. 

I want to improve my performance at work, be more autonomous get more difficult tasks to do and work on more complex projects.

I speak good English, good Italian, not so good German (but good in understanding), I can read in French and when I was young I lived in China and studied Chinese for two years....but it was loooong ago :)
